# AROWBftp
This is the AROWBftp repository for Somerdata's AROW Data Diode file management software. 
Full source code in Python is provided, check the programming notes for instructions on Python version, additional libraries etc.
The suite includes separate scripts for Sending and Receiviing, intended to be run on separate servers each side of the Diode, plus an Emulator to allow code checking and development without the need for a physical device.
